Emacs configuration.

Oriented around vim-style keybindings and PHP programming... for the
moment.

Warning: If you want a good easy Emacs starter pack, please go look at
Emacs Prelude[1] or similar.  I've used Emacs in some form for more
than five years (not counting my long torrid affair with Vim) and thus
am not afraid to totally remap things and enable "scary" disabled
commands[2] and the like.  This is really more for my own personal
use.

Do feel free to steal from it though.


Note about the keybindings:

,f   Find files
,b   Find buffers (open files)
,j   Swap back to previous buffer
,k   Kill buffer

,g   Magit

,e   Prefix key for editing/navigating code (e.g. ,ek brings up the
     kill ring in helm)

,d   Prefix key for searching documents/documentation (e.g. ,dw
     searches the web; ,dm searches manpages)
