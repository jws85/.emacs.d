(defun 9time-to-4time (9time)
  "Convert a 9TIME to a 4TIME.

The 'parse-time-string' function in parse-time.el, and a few other
functions, create 9-tuples (e.g. lists with nine things in them).
This structure is documented here:
https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Time-Conversion.html
It's actually a pretty simple format.

Other functions (notably 'float-time') expect a list that can have up to
4 items in it (but in my experience only has two).  This structure is
documented here, as the return value of 'current-time':
https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Time-of-Day.html

This function attempts to convert the 9-tuple format to the 2/3/4-tuple
format, so that it can then be used with 'float-time' et al."

ISO time formats like:

(defun difference-in-days (timestamp1 &optional timestamp2)
  "Return difference in days between TIMESTAMP1 and TIMESTAMP2.

The timestamps are Unix epoch times; TIMESTAMP1 should always represent
an earlier time (assuming computer clocks aren't set incorrectly).

If TIMESTAMP2 is not specified, it will be the value of 'float-time'."
