;; Notes:
;; This only updates daily -- so anyone looking for more latency is out of luck.
;; But it is free, free, free... just be considerate and don't update too often!

;;; Code:

(require 'xml)  ;; to read XML files
(eval-when-compile (require 'cl))   ;; for the loop macro

(require 'calc-currency-utils)

;; The XML file containing the exchange rates
;; This one is provided by the European Union.
