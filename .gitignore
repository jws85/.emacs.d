# master emacs auto-generated directory -- all of the stuff
# below should be getting shunted into this directory instead
#
# I did say *should* -- as of now (2013-11-22) there is a bug of
# some ilk in projectile that prevents caching of its data between
# emacs restarts unless the cache file is living in ~/.emacs.d
# toplevel.  Ugh.  I like projectile too much to change.
.cache/

# I shouldn't need to block these anymore but I have them here
# just in case.  Probably the biggest weakness of emacs IMHO is its
# propensity to crap files everywhere; I am anal enough about it that
# it really sticks in my craw.
