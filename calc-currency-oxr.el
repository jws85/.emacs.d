;; You will need to sign up and provide an App ID.
;; Open Exchange Rates can be used for free so long as you only submit 1000
;; requests a month or less.  Beyond that, and you'll need to pay.

;;; Code:

(require 'json)  ;; to read JSON
(eval-when-compile (require 'cl))   ;; for the loop macro

(require 'calc-currency-utils)

OXR defines 'alternative currencies' as the following:
 - Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Dogecoin, etc
 - Alternate (black market) valuations for currencies.  As of
   2017-05-20, this consists only of various valuations for
   the Venezuelan Bol√≠var.

Many people may wish to enable this, especially if you need
to know the value of Bitcoin in order to pay cryptolocker
ransoms...

On the other hand, the Venezuelan president Maduro has attempted
to censor sites hosting alternative valuations for his country's
currency[1], so... use discretion if you're in Venezuela?
